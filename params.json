{"name":"Sparkr","tagline":"▁▂▃▅▂▇ in Ruby (and your shell)","body":"# Sparkr\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rrrene/sparkr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rrrene/sparkr)\r\n\r\nSparkr is a port of [spark](https://github.com/holman/spark) for Ruby.\r\n\r\nIt let's you create ASCII sparklines for your Ruby CLIs: ▁▂▃▅▇\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'sparkr'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install sparkr\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Shell\r\n\r\nAfter installation, just run `sparkr` and pass it a list of numbers, like\r\nyou would with [spark](https://github.com/holman/spark). The output is what\r\nyou would expect:\r\n\r\n    $ sparkr 0 30 55 80 33 150\r\n    ▁▂▃▅▂▇\r\n\r\n### Ruby\r\n\r\nThe real reason for this port:\r\n\r\n    Sparkr.sparkline([0,30,55,80,33,150])\r\n    # => \"▁▂▃▅▂▇\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Coloring\r\n\r\nLet's say you have your list of open and closed issues.\r\n\r\n    list = [open_issue_count, closed_issue_count]\r\n    Sparkr.sparkline(list)\r\n    # => \"▁█\"\r\n\r\nBut now you want to format the sparkline so that the open issues are red\r\nand the closed ones are green (to quickly see how you are doing).\r\n\r\nLet's further suppose you use a gem that adds a `#color` method to `String`\r\nfor ANSI coloring, like\r\n[Term::ANSIColor](https://github.com/flori/term-ansicolor).\r\n\r\n    Sparkr.sparkline(list) do |tick, count, index|\r\n      if index == 0\r\n        tick.color(:red)\r\n      else\r\n        tick.color(:green)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n    # => \"▁█\" (colored, trust me)\r\n\r\nTo see how this looks live and in full colour, take a look at\r\n[Inch](http://rrrene.github.io/inch).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
